### This Website
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kylezimmerman/kylezimmerman.github.io)

#### Description
A personal blog for myself, as well as a listing or projects, my résumé and my skills.

#### Technologies Used
- Jekyll
- Markdown
- HTML
- SCSS

#### What I Learned
Jekyll is really cool! Static generators are great for sites that have content added periodically. They end up being fast, cacheable and easily maintainable.
So many sites are on complex stacks running through layers of frameworks and routes, and all they really do is fetch data from a database that is only rarely written to.
